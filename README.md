# Travel-agency
Travel-Agency is a web app made in PHP 7 with the Laravel Framework 5.7. It uses the Amadeus RESTFUL API to get flight information.

## Getting started
This project provides an example of consuming the Amadeus API using guzzle, including the generation of the ```Api Key```and the ```Api Secret``` necessary for this implementation. The Api keys can be founded on the [Amadeus documentation](https://developers.amadeus.com/quick-start-guide/category?id=77&durl=335&parentId=NaN).
