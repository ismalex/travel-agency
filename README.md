# Travel-agency
Travel-Agency is a web app made in PHP with the Laravel Framework; it uses the Amadeus RESTFUL API to get flight information.

## Getting started
It provides an example on consuming the Amadeus API using guzzle, including the generation of the ```Api Key```and the ```Api Secret``` necessary for this implementation. These can be founded on the [Amadeus documentation](https://developers.amadeus.com/quick-start-guide/category?id=77&durl=335&parentId=NaN)
